# Contract-QA-RAG-chatbot

This repository contains the codebase and resources for the development of a RAG system for Contract Q&amp;A, to create an autonomous artificial contract lawyer. Leveraging Langchain, a leading LLM application framework, the project aims to build, evaluate, and improve a chat interface.

## Introduction
Welcome to the LizzyAI Contract Q&A RAG System repository! This project is part of an initiative by Lizzy AI, an Israeli startup focused on developing the next-generation contract AI. The objective of this project is to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for Contract Q&A, with the ultimate goal of creating a fully autonomous artificial contract lawyer.


## Project Objectives
* Build, evaluate, and improve a RAG system for Contract Q&A.
* Develop a chat interface where users can interact with contracts and ask questions.
* Implement retrieval and generation components to provide accurate responses to user queries.
* Evaluate system performance using predefined metrics and benchmarks.
* Implement enhancements to improve response accuracy, relevance, and fairness.
